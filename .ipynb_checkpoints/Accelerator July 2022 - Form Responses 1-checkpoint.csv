As such, to evolve as both an emerging scientist and an individual, it seems only pertinent to want to sharpen and deepen by skills to tackle future investigations or problems to provide greater insight an use of these potential datasets. 

As to why I would like to undertake this journey with EXPLORE, not only am I impressed that such an initiative exists in RSA, but I greatly admire the drive of the institution to provide opportunities to those who, in absence of sufficient financial backing, may not be able to reach their greater potential. Further, as I have not yet stopped studying since leaving school, my earning capacity is limited and would not be able to undertake this opportunity if I were not able to apply for the accelerator program. The allure of this program also resides in the willingness of the institution to assist in developing key soft skills, such as interview and CV development capacities, and support with finding employ.

As part of the training program, I learnt how to use Microsoft Excel to analyse and visualize data. I regularly analysed customer energy supply, billing and payment data to proffer solutions to low bill payment and energy supply issues. Haven seen the importance of data and the impact effective usage of data can have on an organisation, I have been passionate about it. This prompted me to start learning SQL and Python which I have learnt to intermediate level.

When I heard about Explore Data Science Academy from a friend, I was very excited as I have been looking for a well structured program where I can learn more and fully be immersed in Data Engineering. 

This program is a life changing opportunity for me as I intend using the skills I will acquire to fully pursue a career in Data Engineering.
In my country Nigeria, the gathering and usage of data is growing very fast and the demand for Data professionals is increasing and I intend applying my knowledge in helping the government and private organisations make informed decisions about critical problems they face.

I am Olufemi SHODUNKE, a graduate of the University of Ibadan. I studied industrial and production engineering. My love for data was birth in a group assignment where we used stochastic models to forecast demand and supply scales for a beverage company. I proceeded to join the power industry as an Operations engineer. This role spurred my interest more in data forecasting, analysis and the power of big data. 

In 2019 I achieved a downtime reduction of 49% in the zone by using the excel pivot tool to track areas with prevalent blackouts. This improved electric supply to 78% and an overall increase in revenue by one third. I also joined the Mckinsey forward program, where my team and I solved a traffic problem for the UK government using an hypothesis-based approach to problem-solving.

All of these made me realise my love and interest lie in data and its effects on changing the world hence my decision to apply to EXPLORE program in Data Engineering.

The work am doing in trying to help organizations and MSME in Nigeria is too enormous for me and I cannot do it alone, so I need that platform where I can leverage on and connect with a network of professionals and other alumni around the world who I can work with to see how we can achieve this goal and with this connection, I will be able to scale my innovative project ideals across different African countries and eventually the whole continent and beyond.
I will be able to accelerate my work by forming partnerships with external professionals.
The skills and knowledge I will be gaining from the Explore data Science academy are unending.
Having participated in some data analytics online training am keen on leveraging my baseline knowledge and giving my all to learning, and relearning at the feet of the masters at the Explore data Science academy accelerator program.

I have come to realize that being a data scientist takes more than just knowing how to make sense of big set of data. One also needs to understand business issues and how to address them with analytical solutions;
I believe learning with EXPLORE will help me become what is called a ""Unicorn"" data scientist. This term applies to data scientists who are like unicorns, rare and amazing creatures with just the right combination of awesome skills to fit the job. I will become someone with great skills in statistics and computer science who can write, speak publicly, and interact well with other people. I have gone through the proposed curriculum and I can deduce that the program will teach me about techniques and theories from many related fields (i.e., math, computer science, statistics, etc.) that will help me understand and analyze data.
Beyond that, getting on the EXPLORE ACCELERATOR program will help me grow as a person. EXPLORE cross-disciplinary program will equip me with strong communication skills to help me work effectively with teams and clients. I'll also learn analytical and problem-solving skills, and demonstrate ability to apply my knowledge and abilities in real-world settings. In many ways, EXPLORE is the perfect environment for a data science program, where intersections between multiple areas of study are intentionally created.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LGpKFDA-rPhPXcYJFSsmrT2Ty7izV_tW,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gHzj2QAjSP3epTPaRcEQUE__UgZhLene,https://youtu.be/vxdM3EagyiM,DELL LATITUDE Core i5,Wifi,Yes,10,Yes,Yes,Male

My interest in Data Sciences further developed after watching a series on youtube called ""The coded Bias"" - As much as this film has tried to portray the negative side of Data Sciences and coding, it has also inspired me to understand that as a human species, we are bound to adapt to the new ways of living - where technology will become a part of our  lives in order to survive the 4th Industrial Revolution. This has also inspired me to learn new concepts such as Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics- and i am inspired to learn how scientists make it possible to talk to the machines (in a figurative sense) and make them compute and execute huge tasks within such short time frames.
